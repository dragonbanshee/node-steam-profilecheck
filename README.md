A module that blocks any incoming friend requests from private profiles (or optionally scammers)

# Installation
First you will need to install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) if you haven't already. <b>This will only work with Node.js v0.12.x</b>. 

Once you have node and npm installed, type this command in shell, cmd, powershell, etc:
```js
npm install steam-profilecheck
```

Once it's installed, you will need to create your config file, you may use the one in the examples folder, or you can create one anywhere. It must follow the same structure as the one in example.js.
